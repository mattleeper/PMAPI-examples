This directory contains the "apiclient" directory, which in turn contains a Node
client library that can be used to access the Sign-Up Technologies Permission
Marketing API (PMAPI).  It also contains some examples, intended to be used as
tutorials.  These examples explain the basics of API access, starting with the
various authentication methods on offer.

We recommended that you examine the "example-auth-*.js" files before moving on
to the "example-scenario-*.js" scripts.

The examples were deveoped on a Linux-derived system running Node 0.10.0. They
should run on any platform which has the Node and npm installed.
